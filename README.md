## About the Video Course
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. It is programming with asynchronous data streams. Apps nowadays have an abundance of real-time events of every kind that enable a highly interactive experience for the user. We need tools for properly dealing with that, and Reactive Programming is an answer.
This course is a step-by-step guide to create your applications with Java 12 by applying Reactive programming. You will get a hands-on experience wherein each section will build on another so that you will be able to make your app responsive and reliable by implementing Reactive principles with Java. You’ll also apply the best data structures and algorithms that optimize functions and using functional reactive programming.
By the end, you will be fully equipped with the tools and techniques needed to implement robust, event-driven and Reactive applications.
